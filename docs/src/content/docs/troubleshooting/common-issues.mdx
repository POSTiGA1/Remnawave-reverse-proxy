## Deploying bots

If you are deploying bots, ensure that in bot's env or config you're using `local` mode. In that case you can simply enter `remnawave:3000` to avoid problems with accessing panel.

## Adding mirrors for Docker
In some cases like [#40](https://github.com/eGamesAPI/remnawave-reverse-proxy/issues/40) servers, especially which are located in Russia, can't pull the images.  
To fix this issue, you can add mirrors:

<Steps>

1. Create `daemon.json` file:

    ```bash
    nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
    ```

2. Import mirrors

    ```json
    {
    "log-driver": "local",
    "registry-mirrors": [
        "https://mirror.gcr.io/",
        "https://dockerhub.timeweb.cloud"
        ]
    }
    ```

3. Restart Docker service to apply made changes

    ```bash
    systemctl restart docker
    ```

</Steps>
