`Cloudflare Warp Native` is a way to use the Cloudflare Warp service through the WireGuard protocol in `native` mode, that is, with direct WireGuard configuration without depending on the official Cloudflare client (for example, the 1.1.1.1 or warp-cli application). In the context of the wgcf tool, this means setting up a connection to the Cloudflare Warp infrastructure using a generated WireGuard profile, which can be used in any compatible WireGuard client.

## What is Cloudflare Warp?
`Cloudflare Warp` is a service that redirects user internet traffic through Cloudflare servers, providing:

- Security: encrypting traffic to protect data.
- Confidentiality: hiding the user's IP address.
- Optimization: routing through the global Cloudflare network to improve speed and connection reliability.

### Installation of Warp Native

:::danger[Important]
Installation of Warp Native is only performed on the server where the Remnawave node is installed.

### Configuration of Warp-Settings

:::danger[Important]
Run only on the server where the Remnawave panel is installed.
:::

<Steps>

1. Select the `Add WARP-Settings to node configuration` option

    ![Warp Native Add Config](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eGamesAPI/remnawave-reverse-proxy/refs/heads/main/docs/src/assets/en/warp_native_add_config.png)

2. Then select which node to add warp-settings configuration

    ![Warp Native Add Node](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/eGamesAPI/remnawave-reverse-proxy/refs/heads/main/docs/src/assets/en/warp_native_add_node.png)

</Steps>

The following blocks are added to the node's configuration profile:

export const exampleCode = `{
  "tag": "warp-out",
  "protocol": "freedom",
  "settings": {
    "domainStrategy": "UseIP"
  },
  "streamSettings": {
    "sockopt": {
      "interface": "warp",
      "tcpFastOpen": true
    }
  }
}`;
export const fileName = 'outbound';

<Code code={exampleCode} lang="json" title={fileName} />

The highlighted domains will be sent through WARP, replace them with your own.

export const fileName2 = 'routing rule';
export const highlights = ['whoer.net', 'browserleaks.com', '2ip.io', '2ip.ru'];
export const exampleCode2 = `{
  "type": "field",
  "domain": [
    "whoer.net",
    "browserleaks.com",
    "2ip.io",
    "2ip.ru"
  ],
  "outboundTag": "warp-out"
}`;

<Code code={exampleCode2} lang="json" title={fileName2} mark={highlights} />
